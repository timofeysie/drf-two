### Polls

After a while, I need to refresh a few things.

First merge master into dev to update the dev branch after a flurry of work to solve some issues.

Next, run the app locally.

```txt
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
You have 34 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): account, admin, auth, authtoken, comments, contenttypes, followers, likes, posts, profiles, sessions, sites, socialaccount.
Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.

```

Ran python manage.py migrate and started the server and it works as expected.

#### Step 1

Next, scaffold the polls app.

```sh
python manage.py startapp polls
```

#### Step 2

Add it to the installed apps array in drf_two\settings.py.

Register the Polls model in admin.py

```py
from django.contrib import admin

from .models import Polls

admin.site.register(Polls)
```

#### Step 3

Then run make migrations which you have to do after updating a model:

```shell
python manage.py makemigrations
...
    from .models import Polls
ImportError: cannot import name 'Polls' from 'polls.models' (C:\Users\timof\repos\timo\drf-two\polls\models.py)
```

Actually, our guide has no admin.py changes, so roll those back and:

#### Step 4

Migrate the changes.

```py
$ python manage.py makemigrations
Migrations for 'polls':
  polls\migrations\0001_initial.py
    - Create model Question
    - Create model Answer
    - Create model Vote
```

And python manage.py migrate:

```py
$ python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: account, admin, auth, authtoken, comments, contenttypes, followers, likes, polls, posts, profiles, sessions, sites, socialaccount
Running migrations:
  Applying polls.0001_initial... OK
```

Run the server:

```shell
python manage.py runserver
```

Goto the admin url: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

Create a file with the dependencies:

```shell
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

#### Step 5

Create the serializers.py file.

```py
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Question, Answer, Vote


class VoteSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    """
    Serializer for the Vote model. It handles serialization for creating and
    listing votes. Ensures that a user cannot vote more than once per question
    by implementing custom validation.
    """
    class Meta:
        model = Vote
        fields = ['id', 'answer', 'voter', 'created_at']
        read_only_fields = ('voter',)

    def validate(self, data):
        """
        Validate that the user has not already voted for the same question.
        Raises a ValidationError if the user has already voted.
        """
        question = data['answer'].question
        voter = self.context['request'].user
        if Vote.objects.filter(answer__question=question,
                               voter=voter).exists():
            raise serializers.ValidationError(
                "You have already voted on this question.")
        return data

    def save(self, **kwargs):
        kwargs['voter'] = self.context['request'].user
        return super().save(**kwargs)


class AnswerSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    """
    Serializer for the Answer model. Includes a custom method to count votes,
    which is included in the serialization output.
    """
    text = serializers.CharField(required=True, allow_blank=False, error_messages={"blank": "This field may not be left blank."})
    votes_count = serializers.SerializerMethodField()

    def get_votes_count(self, obj):
        return obj.votes.distinct().count()

    class Meta:
        model = Answer
        fields = ['id', 'text', 'created_at', 'votes_count']


class QuestionSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    """
    Serializer for the Question model. Handles serialization for creating
    and listing questions. Includes nested AnswerSerializers to represent
    answers associated with the question, and custom methods to handle
    the creation of answers within the same request as a question.
    """
    owner = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(read_only=True)
    owner_username = serializers.ReadOnlyField(source='owner.username')
    votes_count = serializers.IntegerField(read_only=True)
    answers = AnswerSerializer(many=True, required=True)

    def validate_answers(self, value):
        if len(value) < 2:
            raise serializers.ValidationError("At least two answers are required.")
        return value

    class Meta:
        model = Question
        fields = [
            'id', 'owner', 'owner_username', 'text',
            'created_at', 'answers', 'votes_count'
            ]

    def create(self, validated_data):
        answers_data = validated_data.pop('answers', [])
        question = Question.objects.create(**validated_data)
        for answer_data in answers_data:
            Answer.objects.create(question=question, **answer_data)
        return question
```

#### Step 6

Add: Urls in both polls and main urls and add views in polls.

In polls/urls.py:

```py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    # Questions
    path('questions/', views.QuestionList.as_view(), name='question-list'),
    path('questions/<int:pk>/', views.QuestionDetail.as_view(), name='question-detail'),

    # Answers
    path('answers/', views.AnswerList.as_view(), name='answer-list'),
    path('answers/<int:pk>/', views.AnswerDetail.as_view(), name='answer-detail'),

    # Votes
    path('votes/', views.VoteList.as_view(), name='vote-list'),
    path('votes/<int:pk>/', views.VoteDetail.as_view(), name='vote-detail'),
]
```

In drf_two\urls.py:

```py
path('', include('polls.urls')),
```

Update the polls\views.py:

```py
from django.db.models import Count
from rest_framework import generics, permissions, filters
from rest_framework.exceptions import ValidationError
from .models import Question, Answer, Vote
from .serializers import QuestionSerializer, AnswerSerializer, VoteSerializer

    """

    update, and deletion operations. Updates and deletions are restricted

    """
    queryset = Answer.objects.annotate(votes_count=Count(
        'votes', distinct=True))
    serializer_class = AnswerSerializer


class VoteList(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    """

    def perform_create(self, serializer):
        user = self.request.user
        question = serializer.validated_data['answer'].question

        if Vote.objects.filter(answer__question=question, voter=user).exists():
            raise ValidationError(
                {"error": "You have already voted on this question"})

        serializer.save(voter=user, question=question)

    def get_serializer_context(self):
        context = super().get_serializer_context()
        context['request'] = self.request
        return context


class VoteDetail(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    """
    Allows detailed operations on a specific vote.
    """
    queryset = Vote.objects.all()
    serializer_class = VoteSerializer

## March

It looks like we should not be committing the db.sqlite3 file so adding that to the gitignore file.

```sh
git rm --cached db.sqlite3
```

This is the way to remove the database from source control. Itâ€™s a good idea in general to keep the production database isolated from your development environment.
