## Deployed backend not working

I'm seeing this in the heroku logs:

```

While this is happening, it's a good time to improve the error handling in the frontend.

However, then the backend comes back to life and those errors are gone.  Next however, the google trends API is reporting a network error, which means checking with the AWS EC2 instance.

I'm seeing this again in the Heroku logs again this morning:

```

Looking at the DB, I see this message:

```txt
Important Notice: ElephantSQL has reached its End of Life.

Brownouts are in effect during the entire month of February.

All details are available in the End Of Life Announcement
```

### Heroku Postgres (Easiest option)

```bash
   # Add Heroku Postgres
   heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
   
   # Get your current DATABASE_URL
   heroku config:get DATABASE_URL
```

That will be $17 another month thank you very much.

### Supabase

I am using Supabase for another project, so let's give that a shot.

- Sign up at supabase.com
- Create new project
- Get connection string
- Update DATABASE_URL

Heroku support on the config var issues:

The new config var will not be set, either in the dashboard or with the command line.
I have created a test var also in the dashboard, but when refreshing, it is not there anymore.

Their reply:

```txt
Based on the error reported in the release output, could you please add these specific parameters to your Python database connection code:

    tcp_keepalives_idle=300,
    tcp_keepalives_interval=300

This configuration adds TCP keepalive parameters which often resolves Heroku's connection issues with Supabase.
```
